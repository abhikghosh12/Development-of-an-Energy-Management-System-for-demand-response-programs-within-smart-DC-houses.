As residential building energy demand is ever increasing, so to fulfill consumer energy demand, only the expansion of renewable energy will not be sufficient but increase in energy efficiency is also needed. In year 2014, 144 billion kilowatt hours [bn kWh] of electricity is being used in private household which 25 % of 576 bn kWh of total electrical energy in Germany [1]. Private households could get rid of unnecessary energy costs up to a considerable degree.
As per the German government´s energy concept, a main objective of is to halve primary energy consumption by 2050 in comparison to 2008 [1–4]. The Federal Government Energy´s Efficiency Strategy for Buildings (ESG) can be achieved not only through renewable energy resources generation but also increase in efficiency [5].
The smart DC house is a good option to consider as it increase the efficiency of the house by eliminating converter losses. As demand for electricity is increasing and there a rise in semiconductor devices. So the new efficient way to increase the efficiency of energy is to use DC house instead of AC house. In this study, modeling of an AC house and a DC house is being performed. In a DC house, converter power losses AC/DC/AC and AC/DC can be eliminated. For example, in current practice, PV energy is being used after connected to inverter but DC house uses direct current. Devices operating on DC are being called as DC internal loads. All electronics are DC internal loads. Replacing DC internal loads with direct DC eliminates converter losses. Replacing all induction motors with brushless DC (permanent magnet) motors can save 5-15 % of energy used by AC motors [6,7]. Along with variable frequency drives (VFD) can increase the saving up to 30-50 % [6–9].
The main loads of a house are transport, heat loads, cooling loads and home appliances. So a self-sustaining house with distributed renewable energy sources (DRES) (PV arrays), heat pump, home appliances and electric vehicle are being designed. Figure 1 shows this house can sustain all its energy need through PV arrays, DRES, heat storage system and battery energy storage system (BESS).
